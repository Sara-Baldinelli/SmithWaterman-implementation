# SW_Baldinelli.py

## Author
**Sara Baldinelli**

## Description
This script was developed for the "Algorithms for Bioinformatics" exam on **May 31, 2024**. It implements functionalities for sequence alignment, including:

- Creating substitution matrices with customizable match and mismatch scores.
- Initializing scoring and gap matrices for sequence alignment algorithms.
- Supporting tools and utilities relevant to bioinformatics sequence analysis.

The script is written in Python and uses the `numpy` library for matrix operations.

## Features
- **Substitution Matrix Creation:** Generate matrices for match and mismatch scoring.
- **Matrix Initialization:** Create scoring and gap matrices for alignment algorithms.
- Modular functions to simplify integration with larger bioinformatics workflows.
